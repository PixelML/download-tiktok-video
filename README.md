<h1 align="center">TikTok Download Buttons</h1>

<p align="center">An addon that adds download buttons to the web version of TikTok</p>

I made this mostly for my own needs, but it's also published here:

* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tiktok-download-buttons/kcnchleajedobajlpgkcinfcdmdnfejd)

* [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tiktok-download-buttons/)

## Firefox (Manifest version < 3):

Firefox (and possibly some other browsers supporting WebKit extensions) will need to use the manifest version 2. This addon's default version is 3, which is the recommended version that is also supported by Google Chrome. In order to use this for Firefox, simply replace [manifest.json](./manifest.json) with [.manifest_v2.json](./.manifest_v2.json).

## Not working?

TikTok is known for changing their site often, something that may brake the addon from time to time. If it isn't working, feel free to submit an issue (or a PR with a fix), and I'll look into it. Keeping this addon updated is a priority as long as it's feasible.
